# Day-In-The-Life-Data-Scientist
N.B. This project is finished.

This is a project pulled from an electrical engineering course on probability and statistics (EC ENGR 131A @ UCLA), in which we were tasked with data manipulation and classification as the final project (and as such, is titled "A Day in the Life of a Data Scientist"). Using MATLAB, the code entails manipulating and plotting data, and using disciminant analysis to classify data points to their appropriate class. 

N.B. As with any academic code, the posting of this repository is to demonstrate the code and what I have learned, and is in no way meant to be a resource for plagiarism or cheating (copying code will only stunt your growth as a programmer anyways).
